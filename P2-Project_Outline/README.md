## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will be a diet and meal planning assistant. Having experience with dieting myself, I have realized that it can be quite difficult to stay organized knowing what food to buy and use in each meal, as well as how each meal will fit into a daily routine while still saying under the restrictions you have limited yourself to. My application will allow users to customize a plan that meets their dieting needs.

### Features

Ingredient customization: Users will be able to enter what ingredients they plan to include in their meals. They will be able to enter in important nutritional values which will will help them monitor totals for each meal and each day.

Meal and Day Planning: Users will be able to use the ingredients they have entered to customize their own meals, and use these meals to customize a plan for the day. Totals will be calculated for the user to monitor.

Diet Customization: Users will be able to create diets that meet their personal needs, whether it is meeting calorie restrictions, fat, sodium, carbs; They can set daily limits that will affect which meals will be available when planning their day.

User Login: As each person will have their own needs for a diet, diet restrictions for each user will be different. Therefore account creation and user login will help personalize planning for each individual.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I believe that I will have to learn to use some more advanced front end coding and applications. After my core application is set up, I want to make the usage less clunky, with a more fluid interface.
